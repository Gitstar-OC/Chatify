# Gitstar-OC's :- GPT4O: Code and Conquer project!

This is the hackathon project of [OC](https://devpost.com/Gitstar-OC) submitted [here](https://devpost.com/software/chatify-pd39qn?) 

> Some models will be `deprecated` as I have use nextjs 14.25 for this due to react 19, nextjs 15 `legacy-peer-deps-errors` for most of the packages, don't update your dependencies. It will work fine 

> I have also designed various frontend components usiing various libraries which has been commented and not used because it may take too much time to load the full app and could crash it due to too much animations.
